language into a low level language, such as assembly or machine code?

*Ans: Compiler*

What "language" programmers use when they are at the early stages of designing
and figuring out the main features and functions of a programme?

*Ans: Pseudocode*

    Machine language or machine codes

What is the set of rules that govern the structure and composition of statements
in a programming language called?

*Ans: Syntax*

What is the action of giving variables their starting values?

*Ans: Initialization*

*Ans: if, then, else, do, stop, end, while,*

What are packages of code that compartmentalize and hide complexity called? It
is sometimes called methods or subroutines. They can later be used by calling
its name in other parts of the programme.

*Ans: functions*

*Ans: libraries*

    assigning Statements
    control flow statements

    Operations

## Episode 13 – Intro to Algorithms

"A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other
problem-solving operations, especially by a computer." What is it?

*Ans: algorithm*

A data structure consisting of a collection of elements, usually of the same
data-type, is called? It is sometimes called vectors or lists.

*Ans: an array*

What is the decision problem? (0:53) You just need to copy and paste.

What is the halting problem?(5:03) You just need to copy and paste.


Alan Turing was involved in breaking the codes of German encryption device
during World War 2. What is the common name of the device mentioned here?

*Ans: The Enigma machine*


"A  computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it could deceive a human
into believing that it was human." 
The above statement became the basis of a test in computer science. What is the
name of the test?

*Ans: Turing test*


Who is commonly regarded as the father of modern computer science?

## Episode 16 – Software Engineering

What is the idea of packing up functional units into nested objects called?

*Ans: Object-Oriented Programming*

It is a computing interface that allows collaborating programmers interact
across various parts of a code. What is it?

*Ans: Application Programming Interface*

It is a special-purpose application for writing programs. It integrates many
useful tools for writing, organizing, compiling and testing code. What is it?

*Ans: Integrated Development Environment*

"Good documentation helps programmers when they revisit code they haven't seen
for a while, but it's also crucial for programmer who are totally new to it."
Documentation can be done with comments in codes. It can also be done with a
separate file. What is the file commonly named?

*Ans: README*

Source control, version control, revision control


It is an error, flaw or fault in a computer program that causes it to produce
incorrect or unexpected results, or to behave in unintended ways. What is this
error called in programming?

*Ans: Bug*

What is the action of correcting errors in programmes called?
